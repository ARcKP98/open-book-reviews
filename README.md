## User Experience
### Client Objective
Book readers enjoy reading books more than anything, but even they might have a hard time reading all the books they want to read and therefore might have to be selective of what books they read. The aim of this service is to give users the opportunity to explore opinons about their favourite books or books they want to read, written by other users and to share their opinons to give potential readers an idea of the nature of their chosen book. Open Book review acts as an online service that allows users to do just this. It allows users to read and add reviews to books of their choice in order to share their opinions with a wider audience. Not only can users share their opinions about the books on the website, they can add books on their own that are not on the website but should be to add to the collection.
